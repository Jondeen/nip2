nip menu organisation

here's how it's currently arranged, all ideas for new arrangements welcome

you can change the name of any item, move between menus etc.

once we pick an arrangement, we're stuck with it forever :-(

top level menus are always sorted alphabetically, within each menu, you can
have any order you like

I was thinking (for example) maybe there should be a "Capture" menu: we could
put all the stuff you tend to do when acquiring images in there (eg. crop,
white balance, New_video, etc.)
