imagemodel is the base model class ... imageview_new makes the imagemodel, then
all the component widgets (imagepresent, statusview, paintboxview,
conversionview, imageview) watch this for updates

the conversion from the real image to the display image is handled by
conversion, a sub-model of imagemodel

imageview holds the ref to imagemodel ... destroy this and everything goes
