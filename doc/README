nip documentation

Type "make install" to rebuild html/ and ps/ directories with formatted
docuimentation. You'll need latex and tex4ht.

The Makefile.am in nip2-x.x copies the contents of the html/ and ps/ to 
$prefix/share/doc/nip2 during the main nip2 install process.

Once you have the docs installed, rebuild nip2's help index with:

  cd nip2-x.x/src
  make helpindex.h

to index the HTML docs and link the HELP buttons in nip to the correct place
in the formatted pages.
