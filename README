nip 7.12
========

nip2 is a user interface for the VIPS image processing library. 

	http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk

Getting nip2 from SVN
=====================

Enter:

	svn co https://vips.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vips/nip2

Building nip2 from source
=========================

In the nip2 directory, you should just be able to do:

	user% ./configure
	user% make

then as root: 

	root% make install

By default this will install files to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share/vips,
/usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/man. 

If you have problems, read on.

Building nip2 on win32
----------------------

Probably the easiest route is to use mingw/msys. This provides a GNU-style
build environment for win32. 

	http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Build_on_windows

Alternatively, vips-7.x/win32 contains sample build systems using the
Microsoft toolchain. See the README in there for details.

Building nip2 on OS X
---------------------

I used macports to install all the dependencies. Fink also works.

	http://www.macports.org

You need to tell configure to use the msgfmt from macports. Something like:

	GMSGFMT="/opt/local/bin/msgfmt" ./configure --prefix=/Users/john/vips

Dependencies
============

vips
gtk2
libxml2
	all needed at runtime

flex/bison
	needed at compiletime
	
fftw3
gsl
	optional, but useful

vips8
	not required: internal development only, but you may see warning
	messages

Tips 
----

production build with

./configure --prefix=/home/john/vips 

debug build with

CFLAGS="-g -Wall" ./configure --prefix=/home/john/vips 

(--enable-debug turns on and off automatically with development / production
minor version numbers)

leak check

export G_DEBUG=gc-friendly 

	This makes Glib clear certain memory areas after using them, too.

export G_SLICE=always-malloc 

	This completely disables the magazine and slab allocator in Glib, 
	and makes it use plain malloc()/free() instead.

valgrind --suppressions=/home/john/nip2.supp --leak-check=yes nip2 ...

valgrind --suppressions=/home/john/nip2.supp --leak-check=no --db-attach=yes nip2 ...

or put "--suppressions=/home/john/nip2.supp" into ~/.valgrindrc
