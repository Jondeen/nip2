nip2
====

nip2 is a user interface for the VIPS image processing library.

Getting nip2 from SVN
=====================

	svn co https://vips.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vips/nip2

Building nip2 from source
=========================

If you downloaded from SVN you need:

	$ ./bootstrap.sh

Then the usual:

	$ ./configure ...
	$ make

then finally:

	$ sudo make install

By default this will install files to /usr/local. Use the --prefix argument to
./configure to change this.

If you have problems, read on.

Building nip2 on win32
----------------------

I cross-compile from Linux, usually. See:

	http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Build_on_windows

Building nip2 on OS X
---------------------

I use jhbuild on OS X as well, see:

	http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Build_on_OS_X

Dependencies
============

vips
gtk2
libxml2
	all needed at runtime

flex/bison
	needed at compile time

fftw3
gsl
goffice
	optional, but useful

Tips 
----

production build with

./configure --prefix=/home/john/vips 

debug build with

CFLAGS="-g -Wall" ./configure --prefix=/home/john/vips 

(--enable-debug turns on and off automatically with development / production
minor version numbers)

leak check

export G_DEBUG=gc-friendly 

	This makes Glib clear certain memory areas after using them, too.

export G_SLICE=always-malloc 

	This completely disables the magazine and slab allocator in Glib, 
	and makes it use plain malloc()/free() instead.

valgrind --suppressions=/home/john/nip2.supp \
  --leak-check=yes \
  nip2 ... > nip2-vg.log 2>&1

memory access check

valgrind --suppressions=/home/john/nip2.supp \
  --leak-check=no --db-attach=yes \
  nip2 ... > nip2-vg.log 2>&1

or put "--suppressions=/home/john/nip2.supp" into ~/.valgrindrc
