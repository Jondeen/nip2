- there's some left-recursion in the parser, eg. comma_list, is this easily
  fixable?

- (from a paper describing Miranda's list comps)

  list comprehensions have the form:
  
	[ <expression> | <qualifier> , ..., <qualifier> ]
  
  where each qualifier is either a generator (of the form pat <- expr)
  or a filter (a Boolean expression). The syntax derives from analogy with
  common set notation. For example:
  we have MOREEQ in tree.h, just need adding to stuff

	{x|x ∈ S;P(x)}

  defines the subset of S for which P holds. Similarly:

	[x | x <- s; p x]

  defines the sublist of s for which p x is True. The scope of variables
  defined using generators extends from the generator itself to all qualifiers
  defined to the right of the generator, and to the main expression.

  For example, the following expression keeps all odd numbers of the list
  of numbers xs

	[x | x <- xs ; odd x]

  Generators can be nested as in

	[x + y | x <- xs; odd x; y <- ys; even y]

  which returns all possible sums for all odd numbers in xs with all
  even number of ys. The last generators change most rapidly and a later
  qualifier may refer to a variable defined in an earlier one. Thus this
  defines a simple but quite powerful list iteration mechanism; it is much
  simpler than most “loop” or “do” macros found in Common Lisp
  [6]; it is also more general than the “collect” macro given in [1,
  p 254-256]. It is in a way similar in spirit with the “Series Macro
  Package” of Waters [9] but considerably simpler (our macro is less
  than 20 lines of Lisp...). Of course, our model is much less powerful
  but is very useful anyhow. The limitations of the comprehension notation
  imply that the generated code is efficient without resorting to a program
  analysis like the one necessary in some cases for the series.

  The following Miranda functions show the power of expression of list
  expressions (and also of pattern matching in the function heads):

  • function for quicksort:

	q_sort [] = [] 
	q_sort (a:x) = q_sort [y|y <- x; y<a] ++ [a] ++ 
	  	q_sort[y|y <- x; y >=a]

    which means: sorting the empty list gives the empty list; sorting a
    list beginning with a followed by the list x is appending three lists:
    the first one is the result of sorting all elements of x smaller than a,
    the second only comprises the “pivot ” a and the third is the result
    of sorting all elements of x greater or equal to a.

  • function for finding all permutations of a list of elements

	perms [] = [[]] 
	perms x = [a:p | a <- x ; p <- perms (x -- [a])]

    This is read as finding the permutations of the empty list is the list
    of one empty list; finding the permutations of list x is the list of
    all elements a from x in front of all possible permutations of the
    remaining elements of x. (: is the “cons” operator and -- denotes
    list difference).

  example compilation:

  	z = [(x, y) | x <- [1..3]; y <- [x..3]; x + y > 3] 
		--> [(1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]

  another try:

  	z = $$lcomp1
	{
		// final map
		$$lcomp1 = map $$f $$lcomp2
		{
			$$f $$p = (x, y)
			{
				// insert these locals at the end of the
				// parse when we know the number and order of
				// the generators
				x = $$p?1;
				y = $$p?0;
			}
		}

		// base generator
		$$lcomp3 = [[]];

		$$lcomp4 = concat (map $$f $$lcomp3)
		{
			$$f $$p = map (\$$p2 cons $$p2 $$p) [1..3]
			{
			}
		}

		$$lcomp5 = concat (map $$f $$lcomp4)
		{
			$$f $$p = map (\$$p2 cons $$p2 $$p) [x..3]
			{
				x = $$p?0;
			}
		}

		$$lcomp2 = filter $$f $$lcomp5
		{
			$$f $$p = x + y > 3
			{
				x = $$p?1;
				y = $$p?0;
			}
		}
	}

  haskell has 
  
  	[(x, y) | x <- [1..3]; y <- [x..3]; x + y > 3] == 
		[(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]

  ie. they don't try diagonalisation

- add (*) (operator sections) ... need a binup / uop production? can't
  do this without losing precedence stuff, it'll need a separate production
  for sections

- pattern matching

  	fred (Image x) = rot90 x

  is equivalent to

  	fred x
		= rot90 x, is_Image x
		= error "bad args"

  also for list and complex

  	fred (a:x) = x
	fred [a, b, c] = 
	fred [a, b, ...] =
	fred (a, b) = 
	fred [(a, b), (c, d), ...] = 
	fred [Image x, Matrix y] =




- do we leak for IMAGEVEC/DOUBLEVEC/etc. in vips_call.c? I think we might

- test classmodel_dict_new() ... part of classmodel member automation

  need to implement member edit for OPTION groups

	classmodel_done_member() ... read widget set -> model
	classmodel_buildedit_member( ... model -> build widget set 

  part of the [["key",value]] arg type

WONTFIX
=======

- toolkits / find doesn't find builtins on their name ... eg. search for
  "im_add"

  too hard to fix with the way searching is done now

- turn on update regions during drag, fix the x pos, try dragging, horrible
  flickering as we update twice, once after the drag motion and once after the
  recomp

  if you comment out the explicit vobject_refresh() in 
  regionview_model_update() the flickering goes, but region dragging is then
  very unresponsive

  fix this when we get fast recomp back again

- have a test_types.ws ... test arithmetic on all combinations of _types?

- panner would be cool

- tooltips on Expression rows always show unedited formula

  could special-case formula for things with expression RHS?

- what about iimage, iregion, iarrow ... can we member automate these? why are
  they different?

- can't see error indications in noedit mode

  should set a red background for display area as well as for rowview button?

- need to be able to override cons to be able to make a List class :-(

  see reduce.c:1710

  this will change the strictness of cons ... how much breakage will this
  cause? very unclear

  try this as a quick hack

  need to do this before we can finish List

  need List to make gamma easy

- unselected column headers are too like the bg colour on windows?

- python uses z.real and z.imag to extract real/image, should we add this too?

  we don't really have complex as a true class, so it would be rather odd

  need to add "[a].head" etc as well

- python blocks complex->real with casts ... insists you use .imag/.real or
  abs()

- if nip sees a IM_RW_IMAGE argument, it could automatically do this:

	int
	im_flood_blob_copy( IMAGE *in, IMAGE *out, int x, int y, PEL *ink )
	{
		IMAGE *t;

		if( !(t = im_open_local( out, "im_flood_blob_copy", "t" )) ||
			im_copy( in, t ) ||
			im_flood_blob( t, x, y, ink, NULL ) ||
			im_copy( t, out ) ) 
			return( -1 );

		return( 0 );
	}

  so it would turn a single IM_RW_IMAGE arg into a paired input and output
  arg

  could make im_lineset() into a regular inplace func and rely on nip to wrap
  and unwrap

  junk flood_blob_copy

  nip could do this lazilly ... if we see the user doing

     im_line (im_line ...) ...

  then we could make one memory image and call im_line twice on it
  destructively ... cool! we'd need to check refcounts to make sure the
  intermediate wasn't being used anywhere else

  hmm! might actually be very hard, we don't have true refcounts for things in
  the heap

  need to do it on read instead: 

    - for image i

    - use as an IM_RW_IMAGE arg ... copy to a memory area and pass in memory
      handle

    - return memory area IMAGE j, and set a flag saying "can operate on
      destructively"

    - if we use j as an IM_RW_IMAGE arg, skip the copy and just pass memory
      area in destructively ... we now have two ImageInfo sharing a single
      IMAGE

    - !!!!

    - does ImageInfo allow IMAGE sharing? not sure it does

    - maybe this needs to be a vips8 feature when we'll have refcounts on
      IMAGE

- tooltip on column says which other columns items in this column refer to,
  and which columns refer to items in this column

- how about a nip start folder common to all versions

  so nip2-7.11.14 tries

    .nip2-7.11.14/start
    .nip2-7.11/start
    .nip2-7/start
    .nip2/start

  or maybe

    .nip2/7.11.14/start
    .nip2/7.11/start
    .nip2/7/start
    .nip2/start

  bit less cluttered

  also, we could have

    .nip2/tmp

  and not have multiple nip2 tmp areas

  workspace recover after crash could break though ... maybe keep ws saves in
  .nip2/7.11.4/tmp?

- think again about class arg checks 

  is there some way we can avoid the _check overhead? or at least check less 
  often

- plotpresent/imagepresent could have a common base class with the focus stuff
  in? also kb nav, zoom, drag-scroll

  a bit difficult, because we want two different policies on window resize:
  plot should change the object to match the window

- photographic negative should also be in image/levels ?

  no, it does ->sRGB, (255-) etc., so it's better as a filter

- gtk+ 2.12 has a treeview widget with rectangular select and grid lines

  use instead of gtksheet?

- stop image flickering on clock recomp?

  want background pattern to be a property of the image display widget, not
  the image?

  so we fade in tiles when that section of the image has never been displayed
  before (eg. on scroll or zoom)

  we don't fade when that section has been painted and we are just changing
  the image (eg. on recalc)

  if fadesteps == 1, only paint the sections of the tile for which mask == 255

  this way we will never paint the bg pattern

  need some hack for scroll/zoom ; test for mask == 255 would be slow :(
